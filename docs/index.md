人的一生中会遇到很多人，大多数的人都是过客，只有少部分人随着岁月的流逝依然会留在身边，我愿称之为——亲情。

In one's lifetime, one encounters many people, most of whom are transient, but only a few remain by one's side as the years pass by. I would like to call that—kin.

在这里留下写作痕迹的初衷来自于阅读，书有很多本，适合自己的才是最重要的。阅读无关功利心，喜欢就捡来看看，不喜欢便可放之一侧。

The original intention of leaving writing traces here stems from reading. There are many books, and the most important ones are those that suit one's taste. Reading is not about seeking benefits; if you like a book, pick it up and read it; if not, you can set it aside.

在一些偶然的机会，接触到课外读物以来，每年都会接触一些读本，有的书告诉我这个世界很大，有些书告诉我要领略人类的历史，特别是从未断层的几大文明。我希望，这个网站和历史一样，能够掀起一抹浪花🌊，不至于默默无闻。

Since stumbling upon extracurricular reading materials by chance, I have been exposed to new books every year. Some books have shown me the vastness of the world, while others have enlightened me on the history of humanity, especially the uninterrupted civilizations. I hope that this website, like history, can create a ripple effect 🌊 and not be overlooked.
