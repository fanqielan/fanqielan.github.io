这是我第一次接触到MkDocs建站，之前使用过Hexo，Halo效果也还可以，但是当时基础比较差，所以被折磨的也是很安详的。现在已经渐渐可以学会自己去搭建一个webpage了，也挺神奇的对吧。

This is my first time using MkDocs to build a website. Before that, I used Hexo, and the effect of Halo was also quite good. However, at that time, my foundation was relatively weak, so I was tortured quite peacefully. Now I'm gradually learning to build a webpage myself, which is quite amazing, isn't it?

今天算是开门营业的第一天，在这个小破站里，默默打下基础。好吧，今天也是不那么开心的一天，下雨了，要思考的问题很多，如何平稳的度过这些天的学习，为下一个阶段性的工作而准备，也是首要的。当然，这些都是题外话，每天在这里写点个人传记也不错。

Today marks the first day of officially opening for business. In this small, rundown website, I am quietly laying the foundation. Well, today is also not a particularly happy day, as it is raining, and there are many things to think about. How to smoothly get through these days of learning and prepare for the next stage of work is also the top priority. Of course, all of this is beside the point. It's not bad to write a bit of personal biography here every day.

今日份吐槽就到这里吧。继续做点有趣的事情，比如学一下C，为下一阶段的work打下好的基础！

Today's rant ends here. Let's continue to do something interesting, like learning C, to lay a good foundation for the next stage of work!
